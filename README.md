# pj_14_django
We will create the Recipe Meal Planner using Django step-by-step. Generally, we will implement the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to add the recipe name, day, and the recipe itself. Additionally, we will establish a login system, requiring users to register and log in before creating the recipe meal planner. Once the user has added all the daily recipe information, they simply need to click a single button. Subsequently, a PDF form will be generated, which the user can save for future reference.
